# Decision Tree Analysis - 30 Year Mortgage vs Housing Index

-Using decision tree regression analysis, we test to see if the 30 year mortgage rates can be use to predict home values

-We used the monthly average for 30-year mortgages (FMAC)

-We used the monthly real home price index (Shiller/Yale)

-We tested our analysis using MSE and cross-validation
